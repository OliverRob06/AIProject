# Platformer Game - AI Learning Project

A PyTorch-based reinforcement learning environment where an AI agent learns to play a platformer game through policy gradient methods.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- Pygame

## Installation

### Windows
```bash
git clone https://github.com/OliverRob06/AIProject 
cd AIProject
.\ThePlatformerGame\install\install.bat
```


## How to Run

1. **Run the main menu**:
```bash
python .\ThePlatformerGame\run.py
```

2. **Select your mode**:
   - **1. Player Control** - Play manually using arrow keys and spacebar
   - **2. AI Pathfinding** - Watch the rule-based AI complete the level
   - **3. Train Machine Learning AI** - Train the reinforcement learning agent
