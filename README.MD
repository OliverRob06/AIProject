# Platformer Game - AI Learning Project

A PyTorch-based reinforcement learning environment where an AI agent learns to play a platformer game through policy gradient methods.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- Pygame

## Installation

### Windows
```bash
.\ThePlatformerGame\install\requirements.txt
```

### Linux/Mac
```bash
chmod +x /ThePlatformerGame/install/install.sh
./ThePlatformerGame/install/install.sh
```


## How to Run

1. **Run the main menu**:
```bash
python \ThePlatformerGame\run.py
```

2. **Select your mode**:
   - **1. Player Control** - Play manually using arrow keys and spacebar
   - **2. AI Pathfinding** - Watch the rule-based AI complete the level
   - **3. Train Machine Learning AI** - Train the reinforcement learning agent
